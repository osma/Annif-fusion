# Annif-fusion

Experiment with different fusion methods when combining results from multiple Annif automated subject indexing algorithms

The experiment itself is represented [as a Jupyter notebook](Annif-Fusion-LTR.ipynb).

If you want to run it yourself, you need to install a few Python libraries.
See the notebook itself for details.
