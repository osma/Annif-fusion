    "# Annif Fusion experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Osma Suominen, October 2018**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is an experiment for evaluating different methods to combine results of multiple subject indexing algorithms. We will use a document collection where gold standard subjects have been manually assigned and compare the subjects assigned by three different algorithm first individually, then in combinations created by different fusion approaches. In particular, we will test simple mean-of-subject-scores and union-of-top-K approaches as well as more advanced methods such as score normalization, isotonic regression and Learning to Rank style machine learning. Ideally, we would like to find a method for combining results from multiple algorithm that gives us the best quality results, combining the strengths of individual algorithms (both statistical/associative and lexical) while eliminating the effects of their weaknesses. The findings will then inform the further development of Annif.\n",
    "\n",
    "The experiment was inspired by the Martin Toepfer's paper [Fusion architectures for automatic subject indexing under concept drift](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00799-018-0240-3) as well as discussions with him during and after the NKOS2018 workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to run this yourself, you need Python 3.5+ with the following libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "* jupyter (obviously)\n",
    "* scikit-learn\n",
    "* pyltr\n",
    "* matplotlib (for the final plots)\n",

    "\n",
    "We will use the [\"Ask a Librarian\" document corpus](https://github.com/NatLibFi/Annif-corpora/tree/master/fulltext/kirjastonhoitaja) for the experiment. It contains 3150 short question-answer pairs in Finnish language. The collection is subdivided into three subsets: train (n=2625), validate (n=213) and test (n=312). All the final evaluations will be performed on the test set, which contains the most recent questions asked during the year 2017. However, for some of the fusion methods we will make use of the train and validate subsets in order to fine-tune the way results are combined.\n",
    "\n",
    "All documents in the collection have been assigned gold standard subjects by librarians, stored in `*.tsv` files where the basenames correspond to the original `*.txt` files (which are not read by this code at all and are not included in this repository). Librarians have assigned at least 4 subjects per document; the average is 4.4-4.8 subjects per document, depending on the subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the documents have been analyzed using the [Annif](https://github.com/NatLibFi/Annif/) tool (development version v0.31.0) using three independent automated subject indexing algorithms: TF-IDF vector similarity, fastText and Maui, asking each algorithm to suggest up to 1000 subjects per document (however, we will in practice only load a fraction of these) with scores ranging from 1.0 to 0.0 given to each suggested subject. The subjects suggested by these algoritms are stored, respectively, in `*.tfidf`, `*.fasttext` and `*.maui` files.\n",

    "## Evaluation metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "For evaluating the quality of results, we will use two metrics: [NDCG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discounted_cumulative_gain#Normalized_DCG) which is based on ranked suggestions (if the top ranked suggestion is correct it will contribute more to the score than getting the 2nd or 3rd suggestion right) and [F1 score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score) that only considers binary choices: either a concept is a subject of a document or it is not, there are no fuzzy options. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the **NDCG score**, we can simply use the implementation from the `pyltr` library. Here we limit the NDCG evaluation to the top 20 most highly ranked subjects (i.e. NDCG@20), meaning that subjects ranked 21st, 22nd etc won't contribute to the score (their effect would be quite small anyway do to the discounting performed in NDCG calculations).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the **F1 score**, we can use the `scikit-learn` implementation. However, its usage is complicated by the fact that we are mostly dealing with ranked suggestions in the pyltr format, so we need to convert those into the multilabel prediction format understood by scikit-learn and further binarize the predictions using a thresholding strategy. For simplicity we will pick the top 5 suggested concepts, so we get an amount of subjects that is similar to the librarian-assigned ones (around 4.5 subjects per document), and compare those to the gold standard. The score for each document will be calculated individually and the final result will be the average of those scores (i.e. sample based average).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we will define an evaluation function that is given ranked suggestions as well as gold standard subjects (in both pyltr and scikit-learn formats) and some auxiliary information (qids and cids). It will calculate both NDCG and F1 score, print them out, and also return the scores so that they can be stored for later plotting etc."

    "Each algorithm returns its scores on the scale 0.0 to 0.1, but they may be using different ranges within that scale. Because of this, simple averaging of scores may cause one algorithm which tends to report high scores to have much more impact on the result than another one that uses low scores. We can counteract that by normalizing the scores before taking the mean of scores. `scikit-learn` implements several normalization methods: L1, L2 and max-value. Let's see if they have an effect on merging results."

In this case, we consider each document a \"query\" and the predicted subjects as \"results\" and will try to come up with the ideal ranking of those subjects so that gold standard subjects are ranked as high as possible while non-relevant subjects are ranked lower.

This implementation has some advanced features: it can be connected to a monitor that periodically evaluates the learned model on validation data and keeps track of the learning progress. If the monitor notices that the learning has reached a plateau - no improvement in validation scores has been made in the last K training rounds - it can stop the learning as well as roll back the model to the state when it reached that plateau. This is called *early stopping* and *trimming*, respectively, and it should help guard against overfitting the model on the training data."
