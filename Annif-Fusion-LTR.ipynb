    "# Annif Fusion experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "**Osma Suominen, October 2018**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is an experiment for evaluating different methods to combine results of multiple subject indexing algorithms. We will use a document collection where gold standard subjects have been manually assigned and compare the subjects assigned by three different algorithm first individually, then in combinations created by different fusion approaches. In particular, we will test simple mean-of-subject-scores and union-of-top-K approaches as well as more advanced methods such as score normalization, isotonic regression and Learning to Rank style machine learning. Ideally, we would like to find a method for combining results from multiple algorithm that gives us the best quality results, combining the strengths of individual algorithms (both statistical/associative and lexical) while eliminating the effects of their weaknesses. The findings will then inform the further development of Annif.\n",
    "\n",
    "The experiment was inspired by the Martin Toepfer's paper [Fusion architectures for automatic subject indexing under concept drift](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00799-018-0240-3) as well as discussions with him during and after the NKOS2018 workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to run this yourself, you need Python 3.5+ with the following libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "* jupyter (obviously)\n",
    "* scikit-learn\n",
    "* pyltr\n",
    "* matplotlib (for the final plots)\n",

    "## Document corpus\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the [\"Ask a Librarian\" document corpus](https://github.com/NatLibFi/Annif-corpora/tree/master/fulltext/kirjastonhoitaja) for the experiment. It contains 3150 short question-answer pairs in Finnish language. The collection is subdivided into three subsets: train (n=2625), validate (n=213) and test (n=312). All the final evaluations will be performed on the test set, which contains the most recent questions asked during the year 2017. However, for some of the fusion methods we will make use of the train and validate subsets in order to fine-tune the way results are combined.\n",
    "\n",
    "All documents in the collection have been assigned gold standard subjects by librarians, stored in `*.tsv` files where the basenames correspond to the original `*.txt` files (which are not read by this code at all and are not included in this repository). Librarians have assigned at least 4 subjects per document; the average is 4.4-4.8 subjects per document, depending on the subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the jyu-theses-fin data set, there are around 5.9 gold standard subjects per document.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the documents have been analyzed using the [Annif](https://github.com/NatLibFi/Annif/) tool (development version v0.31.0) using three independent automated subject indexing algorithms: TF-IDF vector similarity, fastText and Maui, asking each algorithm to suggest up to 1000 subjects per document (however, we will in practice only load a fraction of these) with scores ranging from 1.0 to 0.0 given to each suggested subject. The subjects suggested by these algoritms are stored, respectively, in `*.tfidf`, `*.fasttext` and `*.maui` files.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we load some basic modules and define the locations of the data files."

    "## Evaluation metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "For evaluating the quality of results, we will use two metrics: [NDCG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discounted_cumulative_gain#Normalized_DCG) which is based on ranked suggestions (if the top ranked suggestion is correct it will contribute more to the score than getting the 2nd or 3rd suggestion right) and [F1 score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score) that only considers binary choices: either a concept is a subject of a document or it is not, there are no fuzzy options. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the **NDCG score**, we can simply use the implementation from the `pyltr` library. Here we limit the NDCG evaluation to the top 20 most highly ranked subjects (i.e. NDCG@20), meaning that subjects ranked 21st, 22nd etc won't contribute to the score (their effect would be quite small anyway do to the discounting performed in NDCG calculations).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the **F1 score**, we can use the `scikit-learn` implementation. However, its usage is complicated by the fact that we are mostly dealing with ranked suggestions in the pyltr format, so we need to convert those into the multilabel prediction format understood by scikit-learn and further binarize the predictions using a thresholding strategy. For simplicity we will pick the top K suggested concepts (where K varies by dataset), so we get an amount of subjects that is similar to the librarian-assigned ones (around 4.5 subjects per document for the kirjastonhoitaja data set), and compare those to the gold standard. The score for each document will be calculated individually and the final result will be the average of those scores (i.e. sample based average).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we will define an evaluation function that is given ranked suggestions as well as gold standard subjects (in both pyltr and scikit-learn formats) and some auxiliary information (qids and cids). It will calculate both NDCG and F1 score, print them out, and also return the scores so that they can be stored for later plotting etc."

Because of this, simple averaging of scores may cause one algorithm which tends to report high scores to have much more impact on the result than another one that uses low scores. We can counteract that by normalizing the scores before taking the mean of scores. `scikit-learn` implements several normalization methods: L1, L2 and max-value. Let's see if they have an effect on merging results."

Others are given too low scores, resulting in false negatives. We can try to correct some of this bias using a statistical method called isotonic regression, also known as Pool Adjacent Violators (PAV). The idea is to assess the scores given to individual concepts for a document against the likelihood that the concept was among the gold standard subjects of that document. The resulting models (separate models per concept and algorithm), initialized on training data, will then be able to convert raw scores returned by the algorithm to probabilities of the concept being correct. The resulting probabilities are then all on the same scale (0.0 to 0.1) which makes it easy to compare and combine them.\n",

    "One complication is that the frequency distribution of concepts in any training set is likely to be very skewed. Many concepts don't appear at all in training data. Others appear only a few times. We must decide when we have enough examples of a concept to be able to create an isotonic regression model.\n",

If the monitor notices that the learning has reached a plateau - no improvement in validation scores has been made in the last K training rounds - it can stop the learning as well as roll back the model to the state when it reached that plateau. This is called *early stopping* and *trimming*, respectively, and it should help guard against overfitting the model on the training data."
